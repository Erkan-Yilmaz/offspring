System requirements:

  Offspring requires Java 1.7 http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp  
  Offspring is available for Windows, MacOSX and Ubuntu
  
Installation:

  Offspring comes in two versions.
  
  Windows users can download the installer. Download the installer, double click 
  the file and follow instructions.
  
  Users on other platforms must download the ZIP for their OS. Download the ZIP
  file, unzip to a folder any your computer. Double click the executable in the 
  folder where you unzipped the downloaded file.
  
  In both cases Offspring will create a folder in your HOME folder called 
  'Offspring', this folder contains the NXT blockchain files, your wallet 
  file(s) and the Offspring configuration files (for advanced users).
  
First time use:

  Double click the offspring executable (offspring.exe for windows) in the 
  installation folder or where you unpacked Offspring. 

  On first time startup Offspring will ask you to choose a password for your
  wallet file. Offspring offers to store your wallet file in your HOME directory
  in a folder called Offspring. We however recommend that you make use of the 
  feature where you can select your own wallet file. You can choose any name 
  you like and store the wallet anywhere you want, best place is to store your
  wallet on a removable USB thumb drive.
  
  YOUR WALLET PASSWORD IS NOT YOUR NXT PASSWORD.
  
  Your wallet password must be given when you start Offspring, Offspring will
  use this password to decrypt the wallet file on your computer. Inside that
  wallet Offspring stores the actual secret passphrases (private keys) to your 
  NXT accounts.
  
  YOUR WALLET IS FOR CONVENIENCE ONLY !!
  
  YOU MUST STORE YOUR NXT SECRET PASSPHRASES (PRIVATE KEYS) YOUR SELF
  WRITE YOUR KEYS DOWN, IF YOU LOOSE YOUR WALLET YOU WILL LOOSE YOUR KEYS AND
  YOU CAN NO LONGER ACCESS YOUR NXT ACCOUNTS.

  If used first time without blockchain included, Offspring must download the 
  blockchain files.
  You can watch download progress in the lower pane status bar
  
Your Wallet:

  By default Offspring offers to unlock or create a wallet called 
  'offspring.wallet', which is in the directory 
  c:/Documents and Settings/Yourusername

  You run the risk that future malware or hackers will try and steal that file 
  from your computer, even though that file is encrypted that does not mean it 
  can't be cracked given enough time and computing power.

  For enhanced security Offspring offers the ability to select what file is your 
  wallet file. You could for instance insert a USB thumbdrive and from the login 
  dialog browse to that USB thumbdrive and then select which file is your wallet 
  file.

  You must remember what file is your wallet file since we don't store any 
  reference to it.

  Offspring does not care about the name or extension of your wallet file and if 
  it's set to read only or maybe hidden.
  You could name your wallet 'funnycatpicture.jpg' or 'taxreturns.doc' and 
  Offspring will happily unlock and use that.

  Another possibility of selecting your wallet file is that you can use multiple 
  wallets each containing different NXT account private keys.
  
More:

  Offspring will support all current and coming features of NXT.

  Why use the authentic NXT client to store your NXT instead of third parties, 
  for instance your DGEX account?

  Consider the following points:

  * The client enables you to own and operate a genuine NXT account with a few 
    clicks of a mouse
   
  * Take full control of your NXT so you can sleep your nights well even if your 
    favorite exchange has service interruptions
   
  * Send NXT instantly to another account or merchant
 
  * Create tokens for use on merchant sites without the need for extensive server 
    configuration
   
  * If you are a merchant, verify customer payments through tokens manually 
    without the need for custom software
   
  * Participate in strengthening the NXT network and be eligible for random 
    forging rewards automatically by just keeping your Offspring client on.

Backward Compatibility:

  Offspring v0.3 is NOT compatible with older version wallets. 
  To import your NXT accounts to v0.3, please copy-paste your backed up account 
  passphrase to the Add account dialog.

Enjoy!
